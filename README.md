A statistical analysis tool based around DataPoint objects that contain only a unit and measurement.


Current features include:

DataPoints

DataSets - Groups of DataPoints that include basic statistic functions such as mean, median, and mode

Complex DataPoints - Object types such as Observations and DescribedDataPoints store additional information to DataPoints, and have DataSet type objects to encompass them

Environmental Objects - Helper objects that can store Dates and Times

DataSet Constructor - Helper tool that allows you to construct a DataSet using command-line inputs


WIP features:

Calculator - currently only calculates standard deviation of a DataSet

UnitConverter - Unit conversion tool for DataPoints, currently only includes metric and imperial unit conversions

Graph - Extremely undeveloped graphing tool that will eventually allow you to graph complex datasets with custom parameters
